## 1. CORE PRINCIPLES

1.1. This decentralized autonomous community (“DAC”) shall be known as VIGOR DAC and is governed by this Constitution, administered and upheld through the medium of blockchain technology. The hash of the text of this Constitution is permanently recorded on the blockchain and can be amended only with the methods and requirements stated herein.

1.2. VIGOR DAC is founded on the following core principles, missions, values and aims:

a) Building, developing and maintaining open-source software centered around the ideas expressed in the VIGOR Whitepaper: VIGOR DAC shall always strive to ensure that it is able to build open source software for EOSIO software driven blockchains, or other chains as decided. VIGOR DAC should focus efforts on building out, maintaining, running, safekeeping, code of the VIGOR protocol and all related Smart Contracts, software platforms specified in the VIGOR Whitepaper and forthcoming patents. The main underlying purpose should always be creating and maintaining decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. The DAC will never own in any way the VIGOR Protocol or its Smart Contracts, which are open-source and living permanently on-chain in a fully decentralized fashion.

b) Openness and Transparency: All decisions made by the VIGOR DAC governance structures and all its operations will be open and transparent and are permanently recorded on the blockchain. No single actor and/or individual has the power to censor the protocol.

c) Fairness: VIGOR DAC shall treat all members fairly, reward contributions appropriately and keep a non-profit policy. No single voting member should have less information about a decision than others.

d) Decentralization: VIGOR DAC will strive to be decentralized with no central points of failure and it will strive for perpetuity, not being vulnerable to shutdown by any single or few actors or individuals, and being financially self-sufficient for its entire duration.

e) Delegated Mutability: The VIGOR protocol should only be upgradable through the Multisignature consensus of its Custodians.

​1.3. To the furthest extent permissible all the following provisions of this Constitution shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the core principles expressed in this article.
